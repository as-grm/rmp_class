List of cavity tests:

  OpenFOAM solver for cavity cases is icoFoam!

  1. run a simple cavity example in serial
    - cd cavity
    - run serial command run_serial.sh
    - run paraFoam for results preview

  2. run a fine mesh cavity in parallel
    - run prepare_fine_mesh_case.sh
    - run parallel command run_parallel.sh
    - run post_process_parallel.sh for parallel results preview

Preview convergence of simulation:
 - install gnuplot
 - run: foamMonitor -l -r 1 $case/postProcessing/residuals/0/residuals.dat
